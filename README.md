### About Me

I am a Software Engineer working at [Bluelight Systems](https://bluelightsystems.net) as a Tech Lead, most of my repos are private as our clients are government agencies.
I am an Automation junkie ... and current AI/ML landscape is very exciting for me. I want to build general autonomous workers (GAWs) and free people to do what they love.


### Current Plans (2025)

* Continue research for applications in AI, Automation and custom agents
* Create Automation workflows for operating common workflows using AI agents
* Work on a few open source projects:
    * Enhanced relational databases to match better with AI workflow
    * Just-in-time AI models to run quickly on edge/devices/IoT and local hardware
    * Language to action, with measures to account for intentional/un-intentional instruction
    * Document/transaction workflows for the AI/ML age 
* Contribute to projects I care about (there are so many)
* Build 2 games, one in each Unity & Unreal, leveraging AI as much as possible

### Fun fact

I once built a network system for a client's supply-chain application using a closed internal telephone exchange at an Airport, where due to "security" any private networking was not allowed!
