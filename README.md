### About Me

I am a Software Engineer working at [Bluelight Systems](https://bluelightsystems.net) as a Tech Lead, most of my repos are private as our clients are government agencies.
I am an Automation junkie ... and current AI/ML landscape is very exciting for me. 

##### Passion: Design and evolve AI Agents that think, reason, plan, and act autonomously in complex real-world or web environments, with minimal supervision and maximum impact.

I want to build general autonomous workers (GAWs) and free people to do what they love.


### Current Plans (2025)

* Continue research for Agentic frameworks, orchestration
* Evaluate Automation workflows for operating common workflows using AI agents
* Build Agents that plan and execute Multi-Step tasks (Autonomous Decision Systems: RL + planning)
* Contribute to projects I care about (there are so many)
* Explore AI agency and Agents in Video Games

### Fun fact

I once built a distributed network system for a client's supply-chain application on top of a closed internal telephone exchange at an Airport, where due to "security" any private networking was not allowed!
