# Hey, I'm Shamsher ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

I have been:

* co-founder
* CTO
* Software Engineer
* Systems Architect
* and anything in-between

that was required to envision, design, prototype, build and ship Software products from 0 to 1.

Currently at [Bluelight Systems](https://bluelightsystems.net) which I co-founded, most of my repos are private as our clients are mainly government agencies.
I want to change this in 2024

### Current Plans (2024)

* Completely dive **deep** (actual pun) into AI/ML and their applications
* Create a few open source projects
* Contribute to projects I care about (there are so many)
* Build 2 games in each Unity & Unreal, leveraging AI as much as possible

### My tools & stack

- **Backend**
- Python, Go, nodejs, C#
- **Frontend**
- Vue, Svelte, Flutter
- **Databases**
- Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, MS-SQL, SqLite
- **DevOps**
- CI/CD, Docker, Github
- **Cloud Computing**
- AWS, Azure
- **AI/ML**
- PyTorch, Langchain
- **Some Familiarity with**
- Kubernetes, React, C++, Unity & Unreal Game Engines

### Fun fact

I once built a network system for a client's supply-chain application using a closed internal telephone exchange at an Airport, as due to "security" any private networking was not allowed!
