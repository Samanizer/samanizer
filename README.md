### About Me

I work at [Bluelight Systems](https://bluelightsystems.net) as Engineering Manager, most of my repos are private as our clients are government agencies.
I want to change this in 2024

### Current Plans (2024)

* Completely dive **deep** (actual pun) into AI/ML and their applications in enterprise using RAG and custom agents
* Work on a few open source projects:
    * Enhanced relational databases to match better with AI workflow
    * Just-in-time AI models to run quickly on edge/devices/ local GPU
    * Language to action, with measures to account for intentional/un-intentional destructuve instruction
    * Document/transaction workflows for the AI/ML age (for example in supply chain)
* Contribute to projects I care about (there are so many)
* Build 2 games, one in each Unity & Unreal, leveraging AI as much as possible

### My tools & stack

- **Backend**
  Python, Go, nodejs, C#
 **Frontend**
  Vue, Svelte, Flutter
- **Databases**
  Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, MS-SQL, SqLite
- **DevOps**
  CI/CD, Docker, Github, Gitlab
- **Cloud Computing**
  AWS, Azure
- **AI/ML**
  PyTorch, Langchain, Superduperdb, Scikit
- **Some Familiarity with**
  Kubernetes, React, C++, Unity & Unreal Game Engines

### Fun fact

I once built a network system for a client's supply-chain application using a closed internal telephone exchange at an Airport, where due to "security" any private networking was not allowed!
